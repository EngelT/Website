<h2>Changelog,</h2>
    <p>I decided to use the "Blog" page from now on as a kind of "Changelog" page. That means, whenever I make any big changes to the website
    I am going to document them here. Anyone interested in the sourcecode can just view and download it from my GitHub repository. 
    </p>
<h3>03.7.2018</h3>
    <p>Added "modal image viewer" for the my pictures tab. Just click one of the pictures and youÂ´ll see what I did.
    The pictures were sorted into a dedicated "images"-folder. And I added a script.js file for all the javascript code.
    Lastly there was added a copyright sign with watermark to all of my pictures.<br>
    Not to forget... I added this Changelog  
    </p>
