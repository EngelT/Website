    <h2>Guten Tag,</h2>
    <p>  
    I am happy, that you have found your way to my website. This website is a little project of mine. I want to upload the pictures I took with my new camera here. You find the pictures under the "My Pictures" tab inthe navbar.
    If you have any recommendations for the site or found any mistakes e.g. typos, just let me know, I appreciate your feedback.

    All of the pictures were taken by me, with a Sony a6000 and with the 16-50mm kit-lens or the 55-210mm telephoto-lens. Some of the pictures are edited with DxO Optics Pro 11.

    More pictures are coming over the time.
