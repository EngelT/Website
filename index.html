    <h2>Guten Tag,</h2>
    <p>  
    I'm happy you found your way to my website. This website is a little project of mine. I want to upload the pictures I took with my new camera here. You find the pictures under the "My Pictures" tab in the navbar.
    If you have any recommendations for the site or found any mistakes e.g. typos, just let me know, I appreciate your feedback. The website is still in development and nowhere near finished. I am going to change a lot in the future and add new things.
    On this website I also want to try out some new things.
    </p>

    All of the pictures were taken by me, with a Sony a6000 and with the 16-50mm kit-lens or the 55-210mm telephoto-lens. Some of the pictures are edited with DxO Optics Pro 11.

    The image gallery isnÂ´t working like it should (On desktops and devices with larger screens), I am going to fix that problem as soon as possible with introducing a new method 
    for image resizing. Bear with me until I solved that problem. The goal is to create a image gallery similar to the one of Pinterest.
